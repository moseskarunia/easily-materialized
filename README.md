# easily_materialized

A flutter library to help lift up some tedious tasks in setting up material theme properly.

- Fully tested
- Mockable since it's not static (I hate libraries with static since it's impossible to mock)

## Features
- `TextThemeModifier`: Apply font family and color to each of `textTheme`, `primaryTextTheme` and `accentTextTheme` in no time.
